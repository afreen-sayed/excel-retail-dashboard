Retail Sales Performance Dashboard

-- Objective:
The goal of this project was to transform messy retail transaction data into actionable insights by creating a clean, interactive Excel dashboard that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs), sales trends, and customer behavior across months and years. This dashboard serves as a strategic decision-making tool for retail managers and executives.

Data Source:
Raw data was sourced from a CSV file (retail_store_sales.csv) that contained inconsistencies, missing values, and mixed formats.
Data cleaning was done using Excel Power Query, where:
  Null or incomplete records were removed.
  Dates and amounts were standardized.
  Categories were classified properly.
  Duplicate entries were handled.
  Product names and transaction types were normalized for consistency.

-- Dashboard Overview:
The Retail Sales Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive snapshot of sales and customer behavior across selected months and years. It includes interactive elements to allow filtering by month and year, with real-time updates across all KPIs and visualizations.
